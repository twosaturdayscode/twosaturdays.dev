After graduating in industrial chemistry I was more dazed than ever, I had no idea what I wanted or wanted to do, I just knew I had to find a job with this degree .

I watch myriads of videos and read as many articles on how to look for work, I start setting up profiles on various job finding sites, I send out some resumes and I start using LinkedIn as if it were Facebook.

It just does not work.

Meanwhile I found a job as a warehouse worker, I worked there for 9 months until COVID warmly invited me to look for a new job (I've been laid off ðŸ˜”).

9 months in the cold of a warehouse, lifting heavy boxes, doing more or less the same thing every day.

## The clearness

Anyway, at home I had the opportunity to ponder, those 9 months had shown me something, the reason why I was unable to find work was not so much because I was searching in the wrong way (although it is very likely) rather I could not because **I did not want** to find a job with my degree...

That's it, I didn't want to find a job in the chemical field, they all seemed so boring and I couldn't find anyone who would give me some concrete indication.

But why do I say that my job as a warehouse worker had shown me something?

Well, in those 9 months, I didn't limit myself to my daily chores, we were very few in the warehouse, 4 people (small business in professional coffee machines spare parts), it was necessary to fill more roles and I liked the idea of â€‹â€‹being responsible for my work and deciding day by day what to do.
Moreover, in the periods with less load, I enjoyed improving some aspects of our work, I learned Excel, Access, SQL and VBA to create small applications that could support me, like managing the orders, improving the labels using a barcode-based system and rearranging the goods in the warehouse to based on their movements.
In short, I always strived to improving the way we worked even if it was just cleaning and tidying up the work environment.

_**I realized that what I liked most was solving problems, studying, applying, creating and improving.**_

COVID is the perfect opportunity, the best excuse for not having that pressure of looking for a job, I stay at home and decide to study something that was more powerful than Excel, with which I could give in as much as I would to my creativity and why not? Find a job I like!

## The web

Web development was the most obvious thing to learn, also since I started from HTML and CSS it was very rewarding actually seeing the improvements (if I started elsewhere like backend dev I don't think I'd have the patience).

The learning path was not that easy and I'll face this topic in the next post.

### Conclusions

Here are the suggestions I can give to you if you are starting your joruney or looking to change direction:

- Before thinking about whether or not your method is the reason for your failure, ask yourself what your reasons are.

- The money is worth up to a certain point. Prioritize your stress level and your personal growth, money will come later.

- Don't be afraid to chase what you like, in the worst case you will earn less but do a job you like.
